For this part of the Challenge, write a report that describes the key differences in weather between June and December and two recommendations for further analysis.

The analysis should contain the following:

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Results: Provide a bulleted list with three major points from the two analysis deliverables. Use images as support where needed.

## Summary:
- Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.

we can look at prcp for these monthes to see if there is a correlation between temp and prcp

large difference in counts can be resolved by selecting a specific station (preferred with the most counts). This will result the overall count number but bring them closer in range.
