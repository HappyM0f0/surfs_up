# Surfs Up

For this part of the Challenge, write a report that describes the key differences in weather between June and December and two recommendations for further analysis.

The analysis should contain the following:

## Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
The purpose of this analysis is to gather information on the temperatures during the month of June and December. Finding this summary statistics will assist in determining the success of a Surf/Icecream. 

## Results: 
There is a bulleted list that addresses the three key differences in weather between June and December. (6 pt)

- the count of June temperatures are 1700 where December's count is 1517 
- the range of June temperatures are between 64 and 85 where in December the range is largers, between 56 and 83

![December Summary](https://github.com/HappyM0f0/surfs_up/blob/main/images/Dec_description.png)


## Summary:
- Provide a high-level summary of the results and two additional queries that you would perform to gather more weather data for June and December.

we can look at prcp for these monthes to see if there is a correlation between temp and prcp

large difference in counts can be resolved by selecting a specific station (preferred with the most counts). This will result the overall count number but bring them closer in range.
